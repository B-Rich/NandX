NandX: 
=====

Repo for the DARPA CFT / Nand Xplore project. This project showcases the base inherent vulnerabilities in the NAND Flash architecture

***************************************************************************************
This project was funded by the DAPRA Cyber Fast Track program as:
"NAND-Xplore -- Hiding and Finding Data with NAND Flash Error Codes" by MonkWorks, LLC
***************************************************************************************


Per the intent of the research, the code is open and GPL.

In this repo, you will find: 
	{source, documentation about the project and results, whitepapers, presentations };

This repo will be a static snapshot of the research except for updates for the acutal confernce presentations and whitepapers.  If you are interested in my current implementations of the code (and reverse engineering notes for the closed NAND controllers), find it in my other repo <insert link here when it goes open source/>

If you are interested in the project in general, please find me on email or twitter
